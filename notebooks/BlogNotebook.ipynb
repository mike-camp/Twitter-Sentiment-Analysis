    "# Analyzing Twitter Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In social media, trends move at incredible speed.  A hashtag can start trending, become popular, and then die in a matter days, or even hours.   At the forefront of social media trends is Twitter, an online social media site that allows people to write short 140 character comments on anything ranging from politics, to sports to video games.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sheer volume of Twitter data makes analysis challenging however.  There are ~6000 tweets sent out from twitter every second, which means that finding the latest trends is akin for looking for a needle in a haystack while getting sprayed by a firehose.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately there are some good libraries for dealing with twitter data that can allow you to extract meaning from this information firehose.   In this blog post, I will show you how to set up a twitter sentiment analyzer which allows you to see the sentiment, and location of the latest trends in the US and around the world.   \n",
